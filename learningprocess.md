## 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
- The Feynman Technique is a method of learning where you teach a topic in simple, everyday language to clearly see what you know and what you don’t.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The idea that stood out the most for me was how our brain works in two different modes: the focused mode and the diffuse mode. Barbara Oakley explains that the focused mode helps us concentrate and learn step by step, while the diffuse mode helps us relax and see the bigger picture. The surprising part was how stepping away from a tough problem—by resting, sleeping, or doing something unrelated—can help the brain form new connections and give us “aha!” moments. It shows that effective learning is not about constant pressure but about switching between effort and relaxation.

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active Mode:**
- This is the mode you use when you’re concentrating deeply, paying full attention, and working through something logically — like solving a tough math question or writing code line by line.
- **Diffused Mode:**
- This is a relaxed thinking state where your mind wanders and connects ideas more freely — like when inspiration hits you during a walk, shower, or while daydreaming.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
- Break the skill into the simplest possible parts.
- Learn only enough to start practising and fixing mistakes.
- Remove anything that distracts you or slows down your practice.
- Put in at least 20 hours of deliberate, focused practice.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- Divide large subjects into small, manageable chunks and learn one chunk at a time.
- Explain every concept in simple language to make sure you truly understand it.
- Use focused study sessions and take short breaks to let diffuse thinking help you.
- Reduce distractions by silencing notifications and keeping your study space clean.
- Practise consistently every day — especially hands-on tasks like coding and labs.
- Review errors immediately so they don’t become habits.
- Test your memory through active recall instead of rereading material.

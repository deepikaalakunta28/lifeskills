## 1.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea is the “Maui Habit”:
- After I wake up and my feet touch the floor, I will say, “It’s going to be a great day.”
It shows how a tiny, simple action connected to a natural moment in your day can create a powerful, positive habit.
## 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
B = MAP means:
- M = Motivation (your desire)
- A = Ability (how easy it is)
- P = Prompt (the reminder)
To make habits easier:
- Increase Ability by making the habit tiny.
- Use a strong Prompt by attaching the habit to something you already do.
- Do not rely too much on motivation because it changes every day.
## 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit
Celebration creates a positive emotion, and emotion is what teaches your brain to remember a behavior.
- When you celebrate, you feel good.
- That good feeling tells your brain: “Do this again!”
- This helps the habit become automatic much faster.
Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.
## 4.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea is the power of becoming 1% better every day.
- Improving by just 1% daily leads to huge growth over time.
- Becoming 1% worse daily leads to decline.
- This shows that small habits compound into big results, just like interest in a bank.
## 5.What is the book's perspective about Identity?
Atomic Habits says:
- Instead of focusing on results, focus on who you want to become.
- Your identity shapes your habits, and your habits shape your identity.
Example: Don’t say “I want to read,” say “I am a reader.”
Identity-based habits last longer because they match your self-image.
## 6.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make a habit easier:
- Reduce friction so the habit takes very little effort.
- Use the Two-Minute Rule — start with just 2 minutes.
- Prepare your environment (keep tools visible).
## 7.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To make a habit harder:
- Increase friction — add more steps between you and the habit.
- Remove cues from the environment.
- Make the habit inconvenient or slow to access.
Example: delete apps, hide snacks, turn off notifications.
Hard habits are repeated less.
## 8.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Habit I want to do more of: Reading every day
- **Make the cue obvious**: I will keep my book on my bed so I see it every night.
- **Make it attractive**: I will choose a book I enjoy so I look forward to reading.
- **Make it easy**: I will start by reading just one page each day.
- **Make it satisfying**: I will check it off on a habit tracker and say “good job” to myself after finishing.
## 9:Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Habit I want to reduce: Spending too much time on social media
- **Make the cue invisible**: I will move social media apps off my home screen and turn off notifications.
- **Make it unattractive**: I will remind myself that scrolling wastes time and makes me feel less productive.
- **Make it hard**: I will log out after each use so I have to enter my password to get in.
- **Make it unsatisfying**: I will track my screen time so I can clearly see how much time I am losing.
